# Traffic Accident Analysis and Prediction

Explore traffic accident insights, predict accident trends, and analyze accident data with a modern, interactive web application.

## Introduction

Traffic accidents are a pressing concern in todayâ€™s urban environments. This project aims to provide data-driven insights into traffic accidents while offering predictive capabilities for key metrics, including severity, time-range trends, and location-based analysis.

## Features

- **Severity Prediction**: Predict the severity of traffic accidents using historical data.
- **Peak Time Analysis**: Identify high-risk time periods for accidents.
- **Accident Insights**: Detailed visualizations on accident trends, fatalities, minor injuries, and vehicle types involved.
- **Embedded Map**: View accident locations via an interactive map.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Database**: Excel Files
- **Other Libraries**: FontAwesome, Pandas, NumPy
